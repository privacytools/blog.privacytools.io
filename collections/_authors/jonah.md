Hello! I'm Jonah and I'm the administrator of the privacytools.io servers. Occasionally I'll post hopefully interesting stuff about running those servers and other stuff related to the project.

You can contact me at `jonah@privacytools.io` or on Mastodon [@jonah@social.privacytools.io](https://social.privacytools.io/@jonah). I'm also on our [Privacy Forum](https://forum.privacytools.io/u/jonah/summary) and at [our GitHub Organization](https://github.com/privacytoolsIO). Finally, you can generally find me on Matrix at `@jonah:privacytools.io`.
